# 🎬 Youtube Smart Pause

A browser extension that helps you **learn and code efficiently** while working across multiple tabs.
<br/> <br/>
**Problem Statement:** Users need to **manually pause a video before switching tabs** and then resume it again later, where this extension comes handy.
<br/> <br/>
While in some other extensions, every tab gets paused while changing tab, if we turn the extension on.. 
<br/> <br/>
BUTT! What if user's listening to music or podcast, I understand this problem and added a button, to toggle pause or not a specific video.
